# Trends in Modern Web Development
[Cornell DTI](http://cornelldti.org/). Coming soon.

## Introduction
This class will teach students about modern web development technologies, practices, and industry standards to better equip them for academic work, research, interviews, internships, and full-time jobs. 

## What will be taught?
By the end of the course, students will be have a much more in-depth understanding of JavaScript as it pertains to many common software libraries used in web development. These libraries include (but are not limited to) React, Webpack, Node.js, NPM, Express, PostgreSQL, and Google App Engine. The exact technologies can shift from semester to semester as demands from students, and in the industry, evolve and change. What is in demand now may not be desired in two years from now. The primary technologies that this class is powered by can shift from semester to semester to reflect what employers are looking for.

## What are the prerequisites?
As this course will be covering both client-facing and server-side technologies, INFO/CS 2300 (or equivalent experience) is required.

## When is it?
As a seven-week course, the first class meeting will be Wednesday, October 17th. This course will be held Wednesday evenings from 8:35 - 9:25 PM. A location will be announced to students closer to the beginning of the course.

## What is the expected workload?
As a two week course, students should expect to work anywhere from 5-6 hours per week in this course.

## What software will be supported in the course?
You are free to use whichever text editor or programming IDE of your choice. However, course staff will not be able to directly help you with problems that relate to your editor or IDE.
