# Trends in Modern Web Development
[Cornell DTI](http://cornelldti.org/). Coming soon.

## Introduction
This class will teach students about modern web development technologies, practices, and industry standards to better equip them for academic work, research, interviews, internships, and full-time jobs. 

## What will be taught?
By the end of the course, students will be have a much more in-depth understanding of JavaScript as it pertains to many common software libraries used in web development. These libraries include (but are not limited to) React, Webpack, Node.js, NPM, Express, PostgreSQL, and Google App Engine. The exact technologies can shift from semester to semester as demands from students, and in the industry, evolve and change. What is in demand now may not be desired in two years from now. The primary technologies that this class is powered by can shift from semester to semester to reflect what employers are looking for.

## What is the schedule?
Weekly topics are a combination of lectures, readings, and assignments.

## Policies
### Academic Integrity
As a programming course, you may find yourself in a position to copy or appropriate code that someone else has written. Please cite any code or media that you do not have direct authorship of on any assignments submitted to the course. Code should receive a citation to the original author as a comment in your source code, while media citations (images, videos) should be visible on the page that they appear.
### Accessibility
We seek to make this class as inclusive as possible for all students. All lectures will be video recorded for instructor use only. If you have accomodations with Student Disability Services and require access to these recordings, or any other class accommodations, please speak to an instructor and we will work with you to make arrangements as necessary.
### Cell Phones
Cell phones are distracting to you, people around you, and instructors. If you plan on taking this course and sitting in lectures on your phone and not paying attention, you may be asked to leave. Please be respectful of other people.
